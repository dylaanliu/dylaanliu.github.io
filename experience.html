            <div class="subheading mb-0">Data Analyst</div>
            <div id="experience-details" class="experience-details"><p>As a member of the Contract Administration team my daily 
			responsibilities included maintaining consistent contract data in SAP Ariba through reviewing 
			publishing requests submitted by staff, creating compliance reports that outlined hospital 
			spend and volume consumption, and creating contract value analysis reports that provided the 
			hospital with insights on estimated spend or cost increases. On a quarterly basis I had performed
			Business Process Solutions (BPS) audits to ensure the Sourcing department was compliant with BPS 
			audit regulations.</p>
			<p>I identified opportunities to speed up the existing processes with the incorporation of 
			automation tools and macros I developed using VBA and Python. This provided a way for both me and 
			the team to increase the efficiency of the rebate tracker and the savings tracker. The tools 
			reduced the amount of time spent copying data to the tracker from various documents and provided 
			a way to both verify and validate data added to the trackers to maintain consistency.</p>
			<p>My role also involved the management of the rebate process. I took over this process and was 
			the main point of contact for rebate related matters. The process involved determining the amount
			of rebate each hospital was awarded and allocating accordingly. In order to better streamline the 
			process, I had redeveloped the existing rebate tracker giving it a cleaner and easier to read format. 
			The updated tracker also provided an easier way to access important information regarding specific 
			rebates received and determining vendors that required follow-ups due to outstanding rebates.</p></div>

			providing them with an overview of the refresh steps and answering their questions, managing the overall 
			hardware swap, recording the inventory of the IT storage room on a daily basis to guarantee enough hardware
			stock and reporting any shortages, and providing a progress report to the team lead so adjustments to the
